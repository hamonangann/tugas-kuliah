This article is WIP. Some of textbooks I use and recommend. Most of them are used in my college (Computer Science Univ. Indonesia):

- For common people: Automate the Boring Stuff with Python (AI Sweigart) to learn programming and But How do It Know (J Clark Scotts) to learn how computer works. These are NOT textbooks, but are exceptional in explaining computers to non-programmers. The first book is available for free at automatetheboringstuff.com, the latter can be borrowed at OpenLibrary

- Programming Basic: ThinkPython and ThinkJava internet version at greenteapress.com.

- Operating System: The dinosaur book (Operating System Concepts by Silberschatz et al). They have free slides in os-book.com

- Computer Networks: Computer Networking A Top-Down Approach by Kurose & Ross. TCP/IP Layer-by-layer explanation. They also have free slides and videos at https://gaia.cs.umass.edu/kurose_ross/ppt.php

- Site Reliability Engineering: Definitely Google's https://sre.google/books.

- Information Retrieval: Introduction to Information Retrieval by Manning et al from Stanford NLP. Read at https://nlp.stanford.edu/IR-book/information-retrieval-book.html

- Data Structure and Algorithm: The CLRS book. But my lecturer mentions this book is a good alternative http://jeffe.cs.illinois.edu/teaching/algorithms/

- Databases: The Manga Guide to Databases (Takahashi et al). Yes they are textbook writers. Borrow online at OpenLibrary.

- Automata and Language Theory: Elaine Rich book. Available for free at https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~ear/cs341/automatabook/AutomataTheoryBook.pdf

- Calculus: Purcell et al. Definitely the most mainstream textbook you can find everywhere

More coming soon.
